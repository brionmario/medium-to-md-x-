<h2 style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>Welcome to Medmark Playground! 🎉</h2>

🎈 The Medmark Playground is an application that allows users to try out Medmark, a tool for converting Medium exports
to a static site. Follow the steps below to set up and use the Medmark Playground:

## Step 1: Prepare the Medium Export Archive 📚

1. 📥 Download your Medium archive. For more information, see
   [our guide on exporting a Medium Archive](https://github.com/brionmario/medmark#medium-archive).
2. 📂 Extract the `.zip` archive and move it to the `.medmark` folder.

```bash
unzip medium-export-18db8f8a43103a84c063310f8ee1c24fa04369cada4bc909b35643df8676bc3b.zip -d medium-export
mv medium-export /:REPO_PATH/playground/.medmark
```

3. 📁 The folder structure of a typical Medium export archive should look like this:

```
.
├── README.html
├── blocks
│   └── blocked-users-0001.html
├── bookmarks
│   └── bookmarks-0001.html
├── posts
│   ├── 2020-03-17_How-to-set-up-WSO2-Identity-Server-User-Portal-in-an-development-environment-d406d15ec703.html
│   ├── 2020-03-17_OAuth-2-0-Authorization-code-flow-React-SPA-demo-using-WSO2-Identity-Server-5829b890a6d4.html
│   ├── ...
...
```

## Step 2: Modify or Create a Template (Optional) 🖌️

1. ✏️ Modify the existing template(`.medmark/templates/playground.js`) or create a new one based on your requirements.

🔗 Follow this guide for more information on
[creating a custom template](https://github.com/brionmario/medmark#custom-template).

> **Note** This step is optional. Medmark will work with a default inbuilt template if no custom template is defined.

## Step 3: Fire up the Medmark CLI. ⚡️

1. 💻 Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. 📂 Navigate to the root directory of Medmark Playground.
3. 🏃 Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm medmark
```

> **Note** Make sure you have PNPM installed globally on your system.

## Step 4: Answer the Prompts ✅

When running the pnpm medmark command, you will be prompted to provide some information. Answer the prompts as follows:

1. **Enter the path to the `posts` folder of the `medium exported archive`** .medmark/medium-export/posts`
2. **Enter the destination folder for output files** `pages/blog`
3. **Enter the path to the template file** `.medmark/templates/playground.js`

- If you have modified the existing template or created a new one, provide the path to the template file. Otherwise,
  press Enter to use the default inbuilt template.

4. **Do you want to export drafts as well?** No
5. **Enter a comma-separated list of files to skip:** `Press Enter to skip`

- If there are any specific files you want to skip during the conversion process, enter their filenames separated by
  commas (IS is blocking CORS requests by default.,Nice catch. I've fixed the typo.). Otherwise, press Enter.

6. **Do you want to run in debug mode?** No

## Step 6: Explore

You can explore the generated output in the specified destination folder (e.g., pages/blog). The Medmark Playground will
converted the Medium export into a static site, allowing you to navigate through the blog posts and other content.

That's it! Start the application with the following command.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

And go to the `Posts` from the navigation.

Enjoy exploring and testing Medmark!
